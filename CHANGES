NAME
    CHANGES - Revision history for WordNet::SenseRelate::AllWords

DESCRIPTION
    0.12
        Date : November 03, 2008

        1)  Fixed client server model for the web interface. The allwords
            server can run on a different machine, from where your web
            server is running.

        2)  User data is now stored on the client machine so that it is
            easily accessible to the user.

        3)  Added a mandatory --logfile parameter alomg with other optional
            parameters to allwords_server.pl

        4)  Removed --outfile option from wsd.pl and added --glosses options
            to display glosses

        5)  Moved default-stoplist-raw.txt from
            WordNet-SenseRelate-AllWords/web/cgi-bin/allwords to
            /WordNet-SenseRelate-AllWords/web/cgi-bin/allwords/user_data

    0.11
        Date : June 17, 2008

        1)  Removed compounding logic from AllWords.pm. Compounding is now
            done using WordNet::Tools compoundify. The clients, wsd.pl and
            allwords_server.pl don't call compoundify any more. They creat
            WordNet::Tools object and pass it as a parameter while creating
            AllWords object.

        2)  Moved sentence splitter from wsd.pl to a util program,
            sentence_split.pl. All input formats will now assume that input
            is one sentence per line, one line per sentence.

        3)  Removed parsed format test case from t/wsd.t

        4)  Context was considered as a single line if more than one line
            was entered in the textarea on the web interface. Now the input
            is considered as one sentence per line, one line per sentence.

    0.10
        Date : May 29, 2008

        1)  Added proper error messages for the words which are ignored
            during disambiguation. A suffix is attached to the word in order
            to indicate why it is ignored for disambiguation. For example,
            the word 'the' is not defined in WordNet and hence is ignored.
            We attach the#ND to indicate that this word is not defined in
            WordNet

        2)  Added context file and config file option to the Web interface

        3)  Removed --compounds option from wsd.pl as we decided to use
            centralized compoundify module WordNet::Tools

        4)  Added compoundify in wsd.pl. This is done using the centralized
            WordNet::Tools module

        5)  Removed WordNet::SenseRelate dependency of the Web interface.
            Now compoundifying is done using WordNet::Tools

    0.09
        Date : April 10, 2008 (all changes by TDP)

        1)  Modified test cases further to check for WordNet version using
            WordNet::Tools. Changes introduced in 0.08 testing were based on
            WordNet::QueryData's deprecated version test. Now skip all tests
            if we don't find version 2.0, 2.1, or 3.0, and introduce version
            specific tests within those as needed (if results change from
            one version of WordNet to the next).

        2)  Added reference to Jason Michelizzi's MS thesis, which gives
            many details about the AllWords approach, plus experimental
            results

    0.08
        Date : March 20, 2008 (all changes by TDP)

        1)  Fixed bug in AllWords.pm that caused disambiguate to fail when
            window not specified. we now default to window size 3.

        2)  Fixed synopsis in AllWords.pm to provide a cut and paste program
            that should run

        3)  Modified Makefile.PL to allow for use of 'make dist' and create
            META.yml

        4)  Changed release procedure, now using 'make dist' in order to
            avoid CVS export, and also create a directory that unpacks with
            a version number.
