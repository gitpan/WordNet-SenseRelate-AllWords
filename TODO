NAME
    Todo List for WordNet-SenseRelate-AllWords

SYNOPSIS
    Plans for future versions of AllWords, including AllWords.pm, wsd.pl
    driver, and web interface.

DESCRIPTION
  For version 0.08
    1.  Investigate more on tagged text with WordNet::Similarity::jcn and in
        general tagged text with all options. When run via web interface of
        wsd.pl, pos tagged text and jcn together produced output that was of
        the form word#pos, with no sense indicated. Problem lies in
        AllWords.pm

    2.  Add an option in web interface to upload context as a file. File
        should be one line per sentence, one sentence per line.

    3.  Add an option to web interface for uploading config file for
        WordNet-Similarity relatedness measure. This will need to be passed
        through AllWords.pm to WordNet-Similarity.

    4.  The --compound option is not working with wsd.pl, should repair as a
        user might want to use a subset of the compounds in WordNet.

    5.  Investigate on stoplist handling for tagged text. (what is the
        problem here?)

    6.  Change from raw and parsed to a single plain format. The plain
        format will assume that the text has already been tokenized, and
        that each white space separated string is a token (word or
        punctuation mark). The format will further assume that sentence
        boundary detection has already been performed.

    7.  Move sentence splitter from wsd.pl to util program. All input
        formats will assume that input is one sentence per line, one line
        per sentence.

    8.  Expanding set of POS tags that can be used, either by modifying
        AllWords.pm or allowing user to submit a config file of some kind
        defining the tag set. At present limited to Penn TreeBank set of 47
        tags.

    9.  Return codes from AllWords.pm to indicate if no relatedness found,
        stopword, or not in wordnet.

    10. Return codes that identifies trace level (to enable color coding).

    11. Graceful shutdown and restart of web server. Allow for a stop or
        restart command from the command line, rather than having to kill
        the process.

    12. Adding proper logging for server. (What does this mean?)

    13. Make a design decision about whether web interface should
        communicate directly with AllWords.pm via disambiguation method, or
        should use wsd.pl command.

    14. Develop methods for testing web interface, or at least directly
        testing disambiguate method as used by web interface. Should have
        test cases that can be run to demonstrate problems as listed here,
        and also make sure that once they are fixed they stay fixed.

    15. Expand the testing in /t for AllWords.pm and wsd.pl. Right now it's
        quite minimal, and has very limited coverage. We should have
        multiple .t files, organized in some way to indicate what kind of
        testing we are doing, maybe based on format and then options being
        used, as in tagged.t for testing pos tagged data, wntagged.t for
        wordnet tagged data, raw.t or plain.t for that format, and so there.
        There is no reason that the testing be confined to one file per
        module or program as it is now.
