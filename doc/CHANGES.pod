CHANGES - Revision history for WordNet::SenseRelate::AllWords

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=over 

=item 0.12

Date : November 03, 2008 

=over

=item 1)

Fixed client server model for the web interface. The allwords
server can run on a different machine, from where your web 
server is running.

=item 2)

User data is now stored on the client machine so that it is 
easily accessible to the user.

=item 3)

Added a mandatory --logfile parameter alomg with other optional 
parameters to allwords_server.pl

=item 4)

Removed --outfile option from wsd.pl and added --glosses options 
to display glosses

=item 5) 

Moved default-stoplist-raw.txt from 
WordNet-SenseRelate-AllWords/web/cgi-bin/allwords to
/WordNet-SenseRelate-AllWords/web/cgi-bin/allwords/user_data

=back

=item 0.11

Date : June 17, 2008 

=over

=item 1)

Removed compounding logic from AllWords.pm. Compounding is now
done using WordNet::Tools compoundify. The clients, wsd.pl and 
allwords_server.pl don't call compoundify any more. They creat 
WordNet::Tools object and pass it as a parameter while creating 
AllWords object.

=item 2)

Moved sentence splitter from wsd.pl to a util program, 
sentence_split.pl. All input formats will now assume that input 
is one sentence per line, one line per sentence. 

=item 3)

Removed parsed format test case from t/wsd.t

=item 4)

Context was considered as a single line if more than one line 
was entered in the textarea on the web interface.
Now the input is considered as one sentence per line, one line 
per sentence.

=item 0.10

Date : May 29, 2008 

=over

=item 1)

Added proper error messages for the words which are ignored 
during disambiguation. A suffix is attached to the word in 
order to indicate why it is ignored for disambiguation.
For example, the word 'the' is not defined in WordNet and
hence is ignored. We attach the#ND to indicate that this 
word is not defined in WordNet

=item 2)

Added context file and config file option to the Web 
interface

=item 3)

Removed --compounds option from wsd.pl as we decided to 
use centralized compoundify module WordNet::Tools

=item 4)

Added compoundify in wsd.pl. This is done using the 
centralized WordNet::Tools module

=item 5)

Removed WordNet::SenseRelate dependency of the Web interface. 
Now compoundifying is done using WordNet::Tools

=item 0.09

Date : April 10, 2008 (all changes by TDP)

=over

=item 1)

Modified test cases further to check for WordNet version using 
WordNet::Tools. Changes introduced in 0.08 testing were based on 
WordNet::QueryData's deprecated version test. Now skip all tests 
if we don't find version 2.0, 2.1, or 3.0, and introduce version
specific tests within those as needed (if results change from
one version of WordNet to the next). 

=item 2)

Added reference to Jason Michelizzi's MS thesis, which gives many 
details about the AllWords approach, plus experimental results

=back

=item 0.08

Date : March 20, 2008 (all changes by TDP)

=over

=item 1)

Fixed bug in AllWords.pm that caused disambiguate to fail when window 
not specified. we now default to window size 3.

=item 2)

Fixed synopsis in AllWords.pm to provide a cut and paste program that 
should run

=item 3)

Modified Makefile.PL to allow for use of 'make dist' and create META.yml

=item 4)

Changed release procedure, now using 'make dist' in order to avoid CVS 
export, and also create a directory that unpacks with a version number.
