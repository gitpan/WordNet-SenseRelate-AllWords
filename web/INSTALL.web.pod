=head1 DESCRIPTION


=over

=item 1.

This guide provides guidelines for WordNet::SenseRelate::AllWords Web
interface installation. The guide assumes that you are using the 
Apache webserver as installed on a Fedora Core 3 or Ubuntu 8.04 based 
Linux distribution. If you are using a different server or Linux 
distribution, then the setup process will probably vary a little. 
Moreover Your path names may vary depending on how you have installed 
Apache. 

=item 2.

The following Modules and their dependencies are required by the
SenseRelate::AllWords Web interface :

      WordNet::Similarity
      WordNet::Tools
      WordNet::SenseRelate::AllWords

All these modules are available at CPAN. Please refer to README.web.pod
for more information about installation of these modules. Before
installing the web interface all these dependencies must be resolved.
Please refer to INSTALL.pod of WordNet-SenseRelate-AllWords for
installing dependencies.

=head1 Installation steps

=over

=item 1

Make sure you are a super user, more specifically sudo in ubuntu and su in 
Fedora

=item 2.

Assuming that you are currently in the directory where you have downloaded
WordNet-SenseRelate-AllWords, go to the web directory 

cd web/

=item 3.

Copy cgi-bin/allwords directory to the cgi-bin directory of your web
server.

ubuntu

	cp -R cgi-bin/allwords/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/

Fedora

	cp -R cgi-bin/allwords/ /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/

=item 4.

Copy htdocs/allwords directory to the htdocs directory of your web
server.

ubuntu

	cp -R htdocs/allwords/ /var/www/

fedora

	cp -R htdocs/allwords/ /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/

=item 5.

Several output files are created by the web-interface for which it
requires read, write and execute permissions to the user_data/
directory. Thus make sure that "others" user level has
read-write-execute access to the cgi-bin/allwords/user_data and
htdocs/allwords/user_data directory. Similarly make sure if .pl and
.cgi files in cgi-bin/allwords/ directory have execute permission for
all users including "others" user level. This might not be the best
way considering the security related issues. However, at this point
this is how we deal with the permissions. Alternative suggestions are
most welcome! 

ubuntu

	chmod -R 0777 /usr/lib/cgi-bin/allwords/user_data
	chmod -R 0777 /var/www/allwords/user_data 	

Fedora

	chmod -R 0777 /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/allwords/user_data
	chmod -R 0777 /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/allwords/user_data

=item 6.

Starting the web server.

Again make sure you are a super user. We need bash shell to run 
our scripts. So make sure your /bin/sh is pointing to /bin/bash.
Go to the cgi-bin/allwords directory and start the web server
with the appropriate options. You need to provide the path of
your logfile, which is a mandatory option of allwords_server.pl.
First start similarity server, if it is not already running. For
example, we start our similarity server as below. 

/usr/local/bin/similarity_server.pl --stoplist /root/stoplist.txt --logfile /var/log/similarity_server.log --maxchild 8

ubuntu

	If your /bin/sh is pointing to /bin/dash, please make 
	it point to /bin/bash

	Here is what we did during our install on ubuntu
	sudo rm /bin/sh
	sudo ln -s /bin/bash /bin/sh

	Please refer the link below for more information on this
	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh

	Then start the server

	cd /usr/lib/cgi-bin/allwords/
	nohup sudo perl allwords_server.pl --logfile /var/www/allwords_log.txt &

	In this example allwords_server.pl's log is stored at 
	/var/www/allwords_log.txt.

Fedora

	cd /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/allwords/
	nohup sudo perl ./allwords_server.pl --logfile /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/allwords_log.txt &

	In this example allwords_server.pl's log is stored at 
	/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/allwords_log.txt.

You might want to change the following things by using various options
of allwords_server.pl

--wnlocation

	The default WordNet path we use is /usr/local/WordNet-3.0.
	If you have WordNet installed on path other than 
	/usr/local/WordNet-3.0/, you can use --wnlocation option of
	allwords_server.pl and specify your WordNet path. For example,
	if your WordNet is installed at the path /usr/MyWordNet/WordNet-3.0

	perl allwords_server.pl --logfile /var/www/allwords_log.txt --wnlocation /usr/MyWordNet/WordNet-3.0

--port

	We use 32323 port by default. If you want to change this port you can
	use --port option of allwords_server.pl. For example, 

	perl allwords_server.pl --logfile /var/www/allwords_log.txt --port 30303

	Note that the port you are listening on should be same as the port
	you are sending messages to. Therefore, if you want to use this 
	option, you need to change $port variable in allwords.cgi file and
	make it same as the port you are listening on. For example, in this
	case we will set $port variable in allwords.cgi to 7075

	my $remote_port=32323;

=item 7.

Automatic start up.

If you would like the web server to start automatically when your system
is rebooted, you can modify your /etc/rc.local file to include the
following:

ubuntu

	echo "** similarity_server.pl starting ..."
	/usr/local/bin/similarity_server.pl --stoplist /root/stoplist.txt --logfile /var/log/similarity_server.log --maxchild 8

	echo "** senserelate allwords starting ..."
	OLDPWD=`pwd`
	cd /usr/lib/cgi-bin/allwords
	./allwords_server.pl --logfile /var/www/allwords_log.txt
	cd $OLDPWD

	exit 0

fedora

	# start apache (must be done before starting allwords)

	/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl -k start

	# start allwords server

	OLDPWD=`pwd`
	cd /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/allwords
	/usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/allwords/allwords_server.pl &
	cd $OLDPWD

	exit 0
