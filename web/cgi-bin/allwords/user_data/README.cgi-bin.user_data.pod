README.cgi-bin.user_data - [Web] Explanation of user_data directory in 
cgi-bin of Web interface

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For each instance of the web-interface a directory is created under this user_data directory. 
These user directories remain in user_data directory until the processing is complete. Once 
the processing is complete the user directory is moved to htdocs/allwords directory. If an error 
occurs and processing is interrupted then the user directory remains here.

This directory also contains the default stoplist file, default-stoplist-raw.txt which will be used 
for disambiguation. 

So ideally this directory should act only as a temporary residence for these user directories and should
contain only this README.cgi-bin.user_data.pod file and the default stoplist file.
