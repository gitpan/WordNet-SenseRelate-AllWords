README.htdocs.user_data - [Web] Explanation of user_data directory in 
htdocs of Web interface

=head1 Purpose of the directory

For each instance of the web-interface, a directory is created under
web/cgi-bin/allwords/user_data.  Once the processing is complete the
user directory is moved in this directory. If an error occurs and
processing is interrupted then the user directory remains in
web/cgi-bin/allwords/user_data.
